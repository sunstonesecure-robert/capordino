
NOTEs to keep in mind:
When the CPRT data is parsed, there is only a flat list of nodes for the entire framework,
   but each node has the element ID of it's parent.

There are no optional parameters on accessors

Segment maps are where we format the output for the OSCAL file.

Accessors allow us to insert properties into the formatted output. Wherever there is an accessor, the tool inserts the derived text value.

This is a list of accessor types in the tool control files:

"cprtElement": This allows access to one of the listed CPRT node's properties.
	"name of property"		name of property on the current CPRT item
	
"cprtElementNoSpaces": Same as cprtElement, but also replaces spaces with underscores on the derived text value.
	"name of property"		name of property on the current CPRT item
	
"cprtElementNoParenths": Same as cprtElement, but also replaces parantheses with underscores on the derived text value.
	"name of property"		name of property on the current CPRT item
	
"cprtElementDefaultIfEmpty": Same as cprtElement, but if the chosen property is empty, uses a default value.
	"name of property"		name of property on the current CPRT item
	"default value"			value to use if the accessed CPRT property is empty
	
"cprtOscalLookup": Provides the ability to use a segment map for output formatting with a single CPRT node (not a list).
	"cprtParentType"		currently this parameter is not used
	"cprtElementType"		type of this CPRT node's child element to use to derive the formatted output
	"segment map": []		used to specify the desired formatted output

"cprtOscalLookupProp": Returns a single property value froma single CPRT node derived from the search parameters
	"node type name"		type of CPRT node to find on the parent CPRT node 
	"parent element ID"     CPRT parent element node ID to search the target CPRT node, the value "*" can be used to
								search all elements in the framework with the specified type
	"index in list"			index of the item that is being looked up (usually 0)
	"name of property"		name of property on the selected CPRT node

"cprtOscalList": Used to iteratively process a list of child items on the currently processed CPRT node
	"type of parent node"	This parameter is not used currently
	"type of element"		This is the CPRT node type that can be listed as a child list on the currently processed CPRT node
	"segment map": []		List of strings (including other accessors) that are used to construct the output text in the target document

"cprtRootOscalList": Used to iteratively process a list of items listed by type in the entire framework
	"type of parent node"	This parameter is not used currently
	"type of element"		Element type to select from entire CPRT node list on this document (at any level in the tree)
	"segment map": []		List of strings (including other accessors) that are used to construct the output text in the target document

"cprtElementReqType": Returns the CPRT node element ID

"cprtElementReqDiscussion": Returns the CPRT items text field contents

"oscalId": Creates a document unique ID
	"CPRT property name"	Property to use for the first part of the name (usually "elementIdentifier")
	"added string"			String added to classify the id type

"newUUID": Returns a new random UUID
    "ref name"				This is the reference name to refer to the UUID later in the document

"getUUID": Returns the stored value of a previously created UUID
	"ref name"				Name of UUID to return

"oscalDateTime": Returns the current date/time in the OSCAL required format

"fwDisplayName": Returns the framework's user friendly name for catalog documents

"ifNotEmpty": A method to exclude xml tags for CPRT nodes that don't always have content 
	"CPRT node property"	This is the property to check to see if it exists or not
	"Text to show"			This is the text to use in the output document if the property does exist
