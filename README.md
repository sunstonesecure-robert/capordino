# Cybersecurity and Privacy Open Reference Data in OSCAL

NIST makes available many Cybersecurity and Privacy standards, guidelines, and frameworks in a consistent format through a web-based [Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt) for accessing the reference data in JSON (using a schema defined internally and referred to as cprt schema). 

These datasets allow users of NIST resources to identify, locate, compare, and customize content in and across NIST resources without needing to review hundreds of pages of narrative within the publications.  For additional information, users of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference tool can submit comments, questions, or feedback around the toolâ€™s utility to cprt@nist.gov.

To allow the reference data to be leveraged by security assessment and authorization (A&A) tools, NIST is developing this Cybersecurity and Privacy Open Reference Data in OSCAL (capordinoscal) tool that will automatically convert JSON CPRT data into [Open Security COntrols Assessment Language (OSCAL)](https://www.nist.gov/OSCAL) formats (XML, JSON and YAML). OSCAL is an open source project available [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL). For more information about OSCAL contact oscal@nist.gov
